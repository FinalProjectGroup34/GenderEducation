# Proposal

## Research topic
In our Project, we want to figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education, and what types of aspects have influenced those inequalities. For example, we will find out the changes in gender inequalities in education over time, and the distribution of gender education in different countries and areas. In the past, gender stereotypes and biases are rooted and it shows in any other field. We need to study if those gender stereotypes are still present. We will focus on three indicators: completion rate, out-of-school children rate, and literacy rate. To be more specific, the completion rate is the percentage of the cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. Out-of-school children rate is the percentage of children or young people in the official age range for a given level of education who are not attending either pre-primary, primary, secondary, or higher levels of education. Lastly, the literacy rate is the percentage of the population that can both read and write a short, simple statement about their everyday life. The education inequalities will illustrate through those data.

In this research topic, we will collect the demographic of females and males of various ages and analysis the gender education in different indicators.
