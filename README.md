In our Project, we want to figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education and the world distribution of education inequalities in different countries. After knowing the distribution, we will work out whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement have a greater probability of sitting on gender inequality, and observe the relationship between the development degree of countries and gender education.
