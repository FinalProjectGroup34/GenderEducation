In the past, most people had no opportunities to be educated because of financial or society status reasons. Not to mention, women had limited access to education due to gender inequality, leading to high probabilities of child marriage and teenage pregnancy[1]. Currently, things have been improving. As female master’s students, with gratitude and celebration of modern development, the existence of gender inequality in education in recent years is proposed to be explored in this research. Multiple indicators would be used for investigation, such as youth literacy rate, out-of-school rate, etc. In addition to considering gender, geographical factors are also taken into account. In those highly developed countries, generally, girls have the same opportunities to study as boys and everyone has equal rights in receiving education. However, in some countries, people are lacking education resources and boys might be prior to these resources. Therefore, the question of whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement are more likely to situate in gender inequality was also raised. Countries would be categorized according to their development degree and income level. In summary, in this project we wanted to investigate the relationship between gender and education by answering the following three questions: 1) Does gender inequality still exist? 2) If countries have lower educational attainment, is their data also highly unbalanced in terms of gender disparities? 3) Do countries with gender inequality in education have similar characteristics in terms of development? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In our Project, we want to figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education and the world distribution of education inequalities in different countries. We will use some special indicators to show the gender inequalities in education, like out-of-school rates, Schooling completion, and literacy rate. Those data will focus on primary and secondary age. For collecting more information for our education distribution, we also need to know some adult surveys, which include higher education attendance, tertiary completion rate, and mean years of education. After knowing the distribution, we will work out whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement have a greater probability of sitting on gender inequality. We picked up the countries with high educational underachievement and low educational underachievement to observe gender education. Thirdly, we will divide the countries into two groups by using the income: least developed and more developed, and observe the relationship between the development degree of countries and gender education. In the past, gender stereotypes and biases are rooted and it shows in any other field. We need to study if those gender stereotypes are still present. Furthermore, Gender data in education is a significant indicator in order to figure out the gender equality issue and predict the achievement of future improvement in females. In this research topic, we will collect the demographic of females and males of various ages and analyze gender education in different indicators. Research Question: Figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education and the world distribution of education inequalities in different countries. Work out whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement have a greater probability of sitting on gender inequality. Observe the relationship between the development degree of countries and gender education 2.2 Data availability Based on our research topic, education at younger ages and in different gender is studied. After browsing, we found this website UNICEF, which is a strong data source about children and women all around the world. Our proposed datasets are from its Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) database. This database owns a great many indicators for each country related to children and women, such as children marriage rate and women HIV rate, which means each dataset is in comma separated values(csv) format and has columns of different year, country name and indicators. UNICEF gathers these primary data by collecting from their house-by-house interviews, indicating the reliability of its data source. In detail, there are several datasets used in this project with following indicators: Out-of-school rates for different gender and age ranges Schooling completion rate for different gender and age ranges Youth and adult literacy rate for different gender and age ranges To be more specific, the completion rate is the percentage of the cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. Out-of-school children rate is the percentage of children or young people in the official age range for a given level of education who are not attending either pre-primary, primary, secondary, or higher levels of education. Lastly, the literacy rate is the percentage of the population that can both read and write a short, simple statement about their everyday life. These data help to illustrate gender inequality in education. To expand our datasets, we also found UNESCO, which is a world inequality database on education data. It brings together data from DHS, MICS, and other national household surveys and learning assessments from over 160 countries. Users can compare education outcomes between countries and between groups within countries, according to factors that are associated with inequality, including wealth, gender, ethnicity, and location. Therefore, we traced DHS and found the source. The Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS) collects data through more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries. This dataset provides more indicators: Higher education attendance: Percentage of people aged 18-22 years attending higher education. Tertiary completion rate: Percentage of people aged 25–29/30–34, who have completed at least two/four years of higher education. Mean years of education: Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years. Therefore, we would combine all these datasets with variability of country and gender. We would categorize a country based on its income level, such as low-income, medium-income and high-income, investigating whether low-income countries have higher presence of gender inequality in education. However, there are some problems in our proposed dataset: Trend of change in education over years cannot be observed, which limits us to forecast time-series processes. Since surveys and interviews were used for collection, the survey years for each country may range from 2010 to 2022. Since datasets are combined from two data sources and many different indicators are considered, some countries might miss certain indicators. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our proposed dataset was collected from multiple data sources over the past 10+ years. Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) database: It contains information about children and women from over 200 countries round the world, such as children poverty, HIV/AIDS. All data are primary and gathered from surveys organized by UNICEF. DHS: There are over 100 indicators regarding gender and education from our data sources. After screening, the eleven indicators which we chose to use in this project mainly come from six aspects: Completion rate presents the percentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors. The dataset has 3 sheets, each for one level of education. Out-of-school children rate illustrates the proportion of children who fall within the prescribed age range for a particular educational level but do not attend primary, lower secondary, or higher secondary school. The higher the out-of-school rate, the more emphasis must be placed on expanding access to education. Three sheets, one for each degree of schooling, make up the dataset. Literacy rate displays percentage of population (youth and adult) that can both read and write a short, simple statement about their everyday life. A lower rate means more of the population is illiterate. The dataset is separated into 2 sheets, each of which represents an age group. Several problems are discovered: The time period of data collection ranges from 2010 to 2021. Most recent data is used for countries with multiple years of data. Therefore, data of some countries may be collected in 2010 while some may be collected in 2021. It raises the risk of comparison inequality. Developments over the past 10 years have likely increased access to education. Since all data are collected from household surveys, the reliability of this kind of house-to-house survey is questionable. This is also the common problem of primary data source. There are many missing values in our proposed dataset. Our missing value analysis implies there are more missing values for more developed countries. Reasons and details are discussed in Section 3.3. Besides, as the dataset is assembled from multiple data sources, the incidence of missing values increases. Most countries lack at least one indicator. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since we collected 4 datasets, cleaning and transformation are performed separately. In datasets of completion rate, literacy rate and out-of school rate, worksheets are separated using ‘r read_excel’ from ‘r readxl’ package. Columns orther than country name, development level and indicators are all removed, leaving us a 202*4 dataset. Regional development level is categorized into 4 levels, listed sequentially: not classified, least developed, less developed, and more developed. After transforming with ‘r pivot_longer’ (i.e, creating a categorical column for gender), each dataset is now with 404 rows and 4 columns. In addition, the other three indicators are all in one dataset. This dataset contains records from multiple years. Maximum values for each country are chosen instead of most recent values, since it is discovered that some countries have most recent values of 0 but valid numbers for other records. There are over 300 countries/regions in this dataset. Therefore, after combining all data frames together by country names, a data frame with 450 rows and 14 columns are obtained. Each row presents a country/region, and 11 columns records over 1900 indicator data points. 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
