[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion For future directions, we can also focus on the least developed countries and some indicators that caused education inequality in gender, such as education policy, religion, or family income. There is the question if the education policy and religion can facilitate the education bias in gender. What kind of income status in a family will cause education bias in our society? In addition, we can figure out the outcomes that gender bias in education brings to the community or the education system. We can determine if gender inequality in education relates to gender-based violence, child marriage, and representation for women and girls at the policy level. Is the increase in gender-based violence in some countries coordinated with the higher gender inequality in education? There are more and more questions and topics we can think about based on the results we found in previous chapters. "]]
