[["index.html", "Gender Education Chapter 1 Introduction", " Gender Education Qinqi Zhang, Yanqing Wang 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Education is always an important aspect when assessing development, and gender equality also symbolizes development. In the past, most people had no opportunities to be educated because of financial or society status reasons. Not to mention, women had limited access to education due to gender inequality, leading to high probabilities of child marriage and teenage pregnancy[1]. Currently, things have been improving. As female master’s students, with gratitude and celebration of modern development, the existence of gender inequality in education in recent years is proposed to be explored in this research. Multiple indicators would be used for investigation, such as youth literacy rate, out-of-school rate, etc. In addition to considering gender, geographical factors are also taken into account. In those highly developed countries, generally, girls have the same opportunities to study as boys and everyone has equal rights in receiving education. However, in some countries, people are lacking education resources and boys might be prior to these resources. Therefore, the question of whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement are more likely to situate in gender inequality was also raised. Countries would be categorized according to their development degree and income level. In summary, in this project we wanted to investigate the relationship between gender and education by answering the following three questions: 1) Does gender inequality still exist? 2) If countries have lower educational attainment, is their data also highly unbalanced in terms of gender disparities? 3) Do countries with gender inequality in education have similar characteristics in terms of development? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In our Project, we want to figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education and the world distribution of education inequalities in different countries. We will use some special indicators to show the gender inequalities in education, like out-of-school rates, Schooling completion, and literacy rate. Those data will focus on primary and secondary age. For collecting more information for our education distribution, we also need to know some adult surveys, which include higher education attendance, tertiary completion rate, and mean years of education. After knowing the distribution, we will work out whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement have a greater probability of sitting on gender inequality. We picked up the countries with high educational underachievement and low educational underachievement to observe gender education. Thirdly, we will divide the countries into two groups by using the income: least developed and more developed, and observe the relationship between the development degree of countries and gender education. In the past, gender stereotypes and biases are rooted and it shows in any other field. We need to study if those gender stereotypes are still present. Furthermore, Gender data in education is a significant indicator in order to figure out the gender equality issue and predict the achievement of future improvement in females. In this research topic, we will collect the demographic of females and males of various ages and analyze gender education in different indicators. Research Question: Figure out if gender inequalities still exist in education and the world distribution of education inequalities in different countries. Work out whether countries with high rates of educational underachievement have a greater probability of sitting on gender inequality. Observe the relationship between the development degree of countries and gender education 2.2 Data availability Based on our research topic, education at younger ages and in different gender is studied. After browsing, we found this website UNICEF, which is a strong data source about children and women all around the world. Our proposed datasets are from its Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) database. This database owns a great many indicators for each country related to children and women, such as children marriage rate and women HIV rate, which means each dataset is in comma separated values(csv) format and has columns of different year, country name and indicators. UNICEF gathers these primary data by collecting from their house-by-house interviews, indicating the reliability of its data source. In detail, there are several datasets used in this project with following indicators: Out-of-school rates for different gender and age ranges Schooling completion rate for different gender and age ranges Youth and adult literacy rate for different gender and age ranges To be more specific, the completion rate is the percentage of the cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. Out-of-school children rate is the percentage of children or young people in the official age range for a given level of education who are not attending either pre-primary, primary, secondary, or higher levels of education. Lastly, the literacy rate is the percentage of the population that can both read and write a short, simple statement about their everyday life. These data help to illustrate gender inequality in education. To expand our datasets, we also found UNESCO, which is a world inequality database on education data. It brings together data from DHS, MICS, and other national household surveys and learning assessments from over 160 countries. Users can compare education outcomes between countries and between groups within countries, according to factors that are associated with inequality, including wealth, gender, ethnicity, and location. Therefore, we traced DHS and found the source. The Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS) collects data through more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries. This dataset provides more indicators: Higher education attendance: Percentage of people aged 18-22 years attending higher education. Tertiary completion rate: Percentage of people aged 25–29/30–34, who have completed at least two/four years of higher education. Mean years of education: Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years. Therefore, we would combine all these datasets with variability of country and gender. We would categorize a country based on its income level, such as low-income, medium-income and high-income, investigating whether low-income countries have higher presence of gender inequality in education. However, there are some problems in our proposed dataset: Trend of change in education over years cannot be observed, which limits us to forecast time-series processes. Since surveys and interviews were used for collection, the survey years for each country may range from 2010 to 2022. Since datasets are combined from two data sources and many different indicators are considered, some countries might miss certain indicators. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our proposed dataset was collected from multiple data sources over the past 10+ years. Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) database contains information about children and women from over 200 countries round the world, such as children poverty, HIV/AIDS. All data are primary and gathered from surveys organized by UNICEF. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) is a nationally representative survey that collects a wealth of information on various topics in a specific country. The data is processed and presented in the final survey report containing several tables that provide information on specific indicators in a country. The DHS Program supports a range of data collection options that can be tailored to fit host countries’ particular monitoring and evaluation needs. The DHS Program’s basic approach is to collect comparable data across countries. To achieve this, standard model questionnaires have been developed, along with a written description of why certain questions or sections have been included. They have the model questionnaires in each country. Surveys with large sample sizes (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households). In all households, women aged 15-49 are eligible to participate; in many surveys, men aged 15-54(59) from a sub-sample are also eligible to participate. There are three core questionnaires in DHS surveys: A Household Questionnaire, a Women’s Questionnaire, and a Men’s questionnaire. There are over 100 indicators regarding gender and education from our data sources. After screening, the eleven indicators which we chose to use in this project mainly come from six aspects: Completion rate presents the percentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors. The dataset has 3 sheets, each for one level of education. Out-of-school children rate illustrates the proportion of children who fall within the prescribed age range for a particular educational level but do not attend primary, lower secondary, or higher secondary school. The higher the out-of-school rate, the more emphasis must be placed on expanding access to education. Three sheets, one for each degree of schooling, make up the dataset. Literacy rate displays percentage of population (youth and adult) that can both read and write a short, simple statement about their everyday life. A lower rate means more of the population is illiterate. The dataset is separated into 2 sheets, each of which represents an age group. Higher education attendance Percentage of people aged 18-22 years attending higher education. Tertiary completion rate Percentage of people aged 25–29/30–34, who have completed at least two/four years of higher education. Mean years of education Average number of years of schooling attained for the age group 20–24 years. Several problems are discovered: The time period of data collection ranges from 2010 to 2021. Most recent data is used for countries with multiple years of data. Therefore, data of some countries may be collected in 2010 while some may be collected in 2021. It raises the risk of comparison inequality. Developments over the past 10 years have likely increased access to education. Since all data are collected from household surveys, the reliability of this kind of house-to-house survey is questionable. This is also the common problem of primary data source. There are many missing values in our proposed dataset. Our missing value analysis implies there are more missing values for more developed countries. Reasons and details are discussed in Section 3.3. Besides, as the dataset is assembled from multiple data sources, the incidence of missing values increases. Most countries lack at least one indicator. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since we collected 4 datasets, cleaning and transformation are performed separately. In datasets of completion rate, literacy rate and out-of school rate, worksheets are separated using read_excel from readxl package. Columns orther than country name, development level and indicators are all removed, leaving us a 202 \\(*\\) 4 dataset. Ordinal Regional development level is categorized into 4 levels, listed sequentially: not classified, least developed, less developed, and more developed. After transforming with pivot_longer (i.e, creating a categorical column for gender), each dataset is now with 404 rows and 4 columns.These eight dataframes are combined first by countiry names, development level and sex. In addition, the other three indicators are all in one dataset. This dataset contains records from multiple years. Maximum values for each country are chosen instead of most recent values, since it is discovered that some countries have most recent values of 0 but valid numbers for other records. To uniform with other rates, tertiary completion rate and high education attendance rate are multiplied by 100. There are over 300 countries/regions in this dataset, which means around 25 countries only exist here. Therefore, when combining all data frames together by country names, we observed that these 25 countries have NA for development level. Development level is a key criteria for our purpose and we do not want to remove these data as they have valid records. Fortunately, these data has variables of income level. Therefore, we decided to use income level to categorize these countries. In detail, low income countries goes into least developed. Lower middle and upper income countries goes into less developed and high income ones are more developed. Finally, we obtained a table with 450 rows and 15 columns. Each row presents a country/region. 11 columns records over 1900 indicator data points and other columns are country, development level, sex and income group. 3.3 Missing value analysis In this plot, there are 11 indicators visualized. The left side shows how many missing values for each indicator; for example, there are around 220 missing values for the os_p (out of school for primary) variables. And the right side shows the interactions of those missing values. In the graph, 134 rows missed all 11 indicators, and 52 rows missed the last two variables: ly_a (literacy for adults) and ly_y (literacy for youth). In this plot, we can clearly see the missing value in each column with the percentage. In general, there are 42.8% missing values. For the country, development regions, and have no missing value. For other indicators, the ly_a (literacy for adults) and ly_y (literacy for youth) have the highest missing percentage, 65.33%. In this plot, we observe the missing value in different development regions. More developed and less developed areas have higher missing observations, respectively around 50% and 80%. However, the least developed areas do not have much missing. We can see that more developed and less developed are less likely to have education issues. We deduce that there have been no specific related questionnaires and surveys about education topics of literacy, or attendance, the highest level achieved in recent years. To validate and learn more previous finding, we want to further survey that how rows have missing values for all indicators distributed in aspect of development level. This bar plot clearly supports our finding that more developed countries might be no longer focused in education underachievement surveys. Eventually, we remove those rows which are NAs in all indicators. Moreover, we keep the other rows even though they also exist missing values. Since for exploring relationship between gender and education, removing NAs seems unnecessary. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Existence of gender inequalities in education 4.2 Possibility of gender discrimination for certain countries in terms of educational underachievement 4.3 Relationship among development level, education achievement and gender 4.4 Accosiation among indicators", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Existence of gender inequalities in education In this chapter, we will figure out the existence of gender inequalities in education. We will focus on the literacy rate, complete school rate, and out-of-school rate in different periods. Firstly, we want to explore the literacy distribution in genders. In this boxplot, we can know the variability or dispersion of the data. the literacy rate in youth is similar in both genders. The 50% of lr_y(the literacy rate in youth) in both genders are between 90% and 100%, and the median in males and females is around 100%. More specifically, the literacy in females is slightly higher than in males, respectively 99% and 98%. There are outliers, and the minimum rate in females is 29% and 49% for males. For adults, half of lr_a(the literacy rate in adults) in different sex have different dispersion. The rates in females have larger distributions and outliers. In females, most of the rates are between 71% and 96%, while most of the data in the male are higher than in females, and 50% of male rates are between 82% and 98%. The median in males(95%) is slightly higher than 2% in females(93%). In short, the literacy rates in youth have higher literacy rates than the literacy rate in adults in both genders. It illustrates that education has been improved a lot in both genders. In the past, literacy rates in males are higher than in females, and now literacy rates in females have better performance than in males. However, there are many countries in outliers that have a low literacy rate. We still need to improve education in those countries. We also will figure out if this situation is related to the developing regions. Next is to analyze the distribution of complete school rate in primary school, lower secondary, and upper secondary. In general, the complete school rate in primary school is higher than in lower secondary and then upper secondary. The maximum rates of females in each period are higher than males, but the minimum rates are lower than males. In primary school, the distribution of rates in each sex is quite similar in the interquartile range, and the median in females is higher than in males. In lower secondary, the complete school rates in females become dispersive and interquartile ranges are larger than in males. There is the same trend in the upper secondary, and the median female complete school rate is lower than males. In short, some countries achieve higher rates, around 100%, but the trend of complete school rate from young ages to teenage ages is decreasing. The complete school rate in females have more dispersive. Lastly, We use the ridgeline to show the out-of-school rate in different genders. The ridgeline shows the distribution of out-of-school values for 2 groups. All graphs in primary school, lower secondary, and upper secondary show right skew, which is a good sign, and the distribution of out-of-school rates focuses on the small rates. In primary school and lower secondary, they have a parallel distribution in both genders. The out-of-school rate in lower secondary slightly move to the right. The female rates in lower secondary are higher than male rates in the peak, and then the male rates are higher than females. For upper secondary, it is clear to observe that the distribution moves to the right a lot, and the rates at peak become larger around 20%. 4.2 Possibility of gender discrimination for certain countries in terms of educational underachievement In the above section, we validate that gender discrimination in education still exists, therefore, we want to explore more on whether it is a general pattern or only certain countries sit on this situation by visualizing higher education attendance rate and mean years of education. This world map shows that majority countries have no big differences between male figures and female figures. To study how two figures are different, an additional map is visualized for plotting the difference between male and female. In this map, a diverging color palette is used. In detail, light yellow indicates neutral difference. The warm colors indicate female is higher than male while the cold colors indicate the opposite. We observe that the region with male higher than female is mainly in Africa and West Asia. Then we use a bar chart to explore this pattern more. In this bar chart, it shows trend that the fewer years of education, the more the male figure is higher than the female figure. Some outliers with at least 7.5 years of schooling but significantly higher male averages than female averages are detected: Tajikistan, D. R Congo, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, etc. In this Cleveland line plot, for countries with rate over 10%, more countries have female rates higher than male rates while countries with below 10% rates are more to have male rates higher than female rates, even though the difference is not as big as mean education year. This helps indicate that countries with a low higher education attendance rate are having gender inequality problem. In the meanwhile, there are also some outliers, such as Nepal, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Somalia, etc. They have higher male rates but with decent higher education attendance rate. It is worth mentioning that outliers from two plots are highly overlapped. And most outlier countries lie in below average cluster for at least one plot. This situation may also involve in other aspects. Therefore, we investigate the influence of financial and development level of countries. 4.3 Relationship among development level, education achievement and gender By taking development into account, we discover that in general, least developed countries seem to have lower tertiary completion rate and rates of most more developed countries are above 40%. Moreover, there exists more observations that male rates are much higher than female ones in the facet of least developed regions.It validates our hypothesis that low developed regions are more likely to have unsatisfied education situation and gender discrimination. We categorized mean year of education into three cuts and visualized its relationship with development level and gender. From the mosaic plot, there are several noticeable patterns. Firstly, female in least developed countries only have low and middle figures, which mean they barely get educated for more than 10 years. For female in less developed regions, vast majority of them get medium and high figures while high proportion is slightly higher than medium. Secondly, majority male in least development regions lie in middle region. Only very small proportion can receive education for more than 10 years. Male in less developed countries only have middle and high figures. Finally, the regions of more developed countries are deterministic no matter the gender. Everyone from more developed countries can receive at least 10 years of education, which represents adequacy and equal distribution of educational resources. 4.4 Accosiation among indicators At last, we want to see the association between our indicators. We divided our variables into two parts, youth education and higher education. The first part is five variables: literacy rate in youth, the complete rate in primary and lower secondary, and the out-of-school rate in primary and lower secondary. The second part for higher education is five variables: literacy rate in adults, the complete rate in upper secondary, and the out-of-school rate in upper secondary, complete 2yrs higher education rate between 25 and 29, and attend higher education rate between 18 and 22. In the first parallel coordinate, we can observe that all variables have a strong relationship. The complete rate in the primary has an opposite relationship with the out-of-school rate in primary, and the out-of-school rate in primary has opposite relation with literacy in youth age. Similarly, the literacy rate has a different direction from the out-of-school rate in lower secondary but positively coordinates with the complete school rate in lower secondary. In this parallel coordinate, the out-of-school rate in upper secondary, out-of-school rate in upper secondary, and complete 2-year higher education have a clear relationship. Most adult literacy rates positively correlate with the complete rate in upper secondary. In addition, there is no such relationship between complete 2yrs higher education rates between 25 and 29 and attend higher education rates between 18 and 22. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Male Female This heatmap supports that less developed regions have fewer educational resources, resulting in lower rates in related indicators. It also shows a tendency that more-educated females seem more likely to live in more developed countries. Moreover, we also find this interesting trend that in the tertiary education aspect, female rates are better than male rates, which is consistent with what we find during our exploration.
